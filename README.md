# PhD position 

The position is funded by a research grant from the German Research Foundation focused on investigating the mental lexicon using behavioral data and computational modelling. The position is for 26 hours of work per week (65%). The salary and benefits are determined by the collective bargaining agreement for public employees in Germany (TV-L 13 Ost; 100%). This is a temporary position initially limited to a term of 36 months.

The University of Potsdam hosts leading groups in cognitive sciences and linguistics, providing a vibrant interdisciplinary scientific environment (http://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/cognitive-sciences/index.html). The lab is associated with the Collaborative Research Center SFB 1287 „Limits of variability in language” (https://www.uni-potsdam.de/sfb1287/index.html).

Potsdam is an attractive historical city and its palaces are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Furthermore, Potsdam is at close commuting distance to Berlin, a culturally vibrant and progressive city. Both cities have a high quality of life at modest living costs.

Project and responsibilities
The goal of this project is to model the cognitive mechanisms underlying the production of utterances. Using behavioral experiments and computational modelling, it will examine the role of usage on these mechanisms and test a novel model of language production in which words in long term memory are linked to one another, the strength of these links depending on (and being further modulated by) usage. The PhD student will take the lead in designing and implementing behavioral experiments, collecting and analyzing the data. S/he will im-plement several computational models, using, among other tools, naïve discriminative learning. S/he work under the supervision of Audrey Bürki.
